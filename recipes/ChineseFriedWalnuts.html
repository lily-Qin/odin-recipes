        <a> Chinese-style candied walnuts. </a>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound shelled walnuts</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place walnuts in a medium stock pot. Cover with water and boil for 2 minutes. Strain, but do not rinse. Transfer to a bowl and toss with sugar while still hot until well coated.</li>
            <li>Heat 3 inches of oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. When oil appears to shimmer, fry 1 nut to test for heat. Nut should begin to sizzle immediately.</li>
            <li>Fry 1/3 of the batch of nuts at a time uncovered, 4 to 5 minutes. Toss nuts before each batch and repeat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer each batch to a cookie sheet to cool. Season to taste with salt and break apart when cool.</li>
        </ol>
